(defn ^com.novemberain.langohr.exchange.DeclareOk declare
  "Declares an exchange using exchange.declare AMQP method.

   By default declares non-autodeleted non-durable exchanges.

   Core exchange types:

    - direct: 1:1 form of communication. Routing key defines how broker will direct message from producer to the consumer.
    - fanout: 1:N message delivery pattern. No routing keys are involved. You bind a queue to exchange and messages sent to that exchange are delivered to all bound queues.
    - topic: used for 1:n and n:m communication. In this case, routing key is defined as a pattern. For example \"langohr.#\" will match \"langohr.samples\" and \"langohr.smamples\" or \"#.samples\" will match \"langor.samples\" and \"shmangor.samples\".

   Usage example:

       (lhe/declare channel exchange \"direct\" :auto-delete false, :durable true)

   Options
     :auto-delete (default: false): If set when creating a new exchange, the exchange will be marked as durable. Durable exchanges remain active when a server restarts. Non-durable exchanges (transient exchanges) are purged if/when a server restarts.
     :durable (default: false): indicates wether the exchange is durable. Information about Durable Exchanges is persisted and restored after server restart. Non-durable (transient) exchanges do not survive the server restart.
     :internal (default: false): If set, the exchange may not be used directly by publishers, but only when bound to other exchanges. Internal exchanges are used to construct wiring that is not visible to applications."
